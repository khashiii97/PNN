# PNN
An Implementation Of Progressive Neural Networks for Intrusion Detection Systems <br/>
This repository hosts a basic implementation of Progressive Neural Networks(PNN) as stated in the original paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04671.pdf).<br/>
This implementation will be used in a research project conducted in the Information, Network, and Learning Lab ([INL](https://inl-lab.net/)). After the research paper is published, further experiments and results will be provided.
